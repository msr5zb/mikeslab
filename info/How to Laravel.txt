How To Install Laravel: Note we're using V5.0 because our server php version is older than 5.9.
http://laravel.com/docs/5.0


Use: "php composer.phar require "laravel/installer=~1.1"" to install laravel
Note, we are not using "composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1" because we do not want it globally installed.


To Access, use 
"vendor/bin/laravel [command]"
